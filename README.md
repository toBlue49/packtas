Since this datapack is in early alpha so there's not much but:

  - In the Inventory there's an Clock which when dropped opens an menu.
  - Change the Game Speed with ease
  - Freeze (and unfreeze) the Game!
  - No Mods, Resource Packs or other downloads needed.
  - Works in the newest Snapshot and Versions!
